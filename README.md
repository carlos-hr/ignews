## üíª About the Project

  Ignews is a project developed with Nextjs during Rocketseat's Ignite course, which aims to simulate a page that provides news by subscription, where once subscribed you can follow the published content, and if you are not subscribed you can see previews of the news.
The project relies on GitHub authentication and also uses stripe in test mode to intermediate payments.
